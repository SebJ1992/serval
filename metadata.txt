description=Map tool to set raster cell values.
version=0.8.1
author=Radoslaw Pasiok
email=rpasiok@gmail.com

about=Usage: The tool has 3 modes: probing, drawing and erasing. In the probing mode cell values are read and can be changed manually in a spinbox. In drawing mode, chosen pixel band values are written to disk. Erasing is assigning NoData value. For 3 bands rasters, native QGIS color picker can be used to define bands values.
Warning: All changes are immediately written to disk. Always work on a copy!
