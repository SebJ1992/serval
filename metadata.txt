description=Map tool to set raster cell values.
version=0.7
author=Radoslaw Pasiok
email=rpasiok@gmail.com

about=Usage: The tool has 2 modes: probing and drawing. In the probing mode cell values are read and can be changed manually in a spin box. In drawing mode, chosen pixel band values are written to disk. For 3 bands rasters, native QGIS color picker can be used to define bands values.
Warning: All changes are immediately written to disk. Always work on a copy!
